# Check-In-System
When people are displaced in an often chaotic manner, the necessity of organizing where people are and what their health situation is like is crucial. Through vigorous research conducted for state of the art reports, a check in and monitoring system for displaced people in a natural disaster was found to be necessary. The final design to combat this problem was the Disaster Check in System (DCIS). This system encompassed aspects from both the hardware and software domains of engineering. The majority of the project was focussed on the software aspect, the DCIS application. This application was a readable and writable database with specific user entered fields that would help the user locate their missing loved ones. This application would be deployed in various relief shelters and stations after a tsunami has taken place.
